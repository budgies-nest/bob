# Top 20 Most Asked Questions About Docker Compose with Answers

1. **What is Docker Compose?**  
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using a single YAML file to configure all services, networks, and volumes.

2. **Why should I use Docker Compose?**  
It simplifies managing multi-container applications by allowing you to define all services in one file and start them with a single command, improving development speed and environment consistency.

3. **How do I install Docker Compose?**  
Docker Compose is included with Docker Desktop on Windows and Mac. On Linux, you can install it separately following the official Docker Compose installation guide.

4. **What is a `docker-compose.yml` file?**  
It is a YAML file where you define your application's services, networks, and volumes for Docker Compose to create and manage.

5. **How do I start services with Docker Compose?**  
Run `docker compose up` in the directory containing your `docker-compose.yml` file to create and start all defined services.

6. **How do I stop and remove containers created by Docker Compose?**  
Use `docker compose down` to stop and remove containers, networks, and default volumes created by `up`.

7. **Can I run one-off commands in a service container?**  
Yes, use `docker compose run <service> <command>` to run a one-off command inside a service container.

8. **How do I rebuild images in Docker Compose?**  
Use `docker compose build` to build or rebuild images defined in your Compose file.

9. **How do I view logs of running services?**  
Run `docker compose logs` to see the output logs of all services, or `docker compose logs <service>` for a specific service.

10. **How do I scale services with Docker Compose?**  
Use `docker compose up --scale <service>=<number>` to run multiple instances of a service.

11. **How do I execute a command inside a running container?**  
Use `docker compose exec <service> <command>` to run commands inside a running service container.

12. **How do I list running containers managed by Docker Compose?**  
Run `docker compose ps` to list containers started by Compose.

13. **How do I persist data in Docker Compose?**  
Define volumes in your Compose file to persist data outside the container lifecycle.

14. **Can I use environment variables in Docker Compose files?**  
Yes, Compose supports environment variables in the YAML file and `.env` files for configuration flexibility.

15. **What is the difference between `docker-compose` and `docker compose`?**  
`docker-compose` is the standalone CLI tool (v1), while `docker compose` is the newer integrated CLI plugin (v2) included with Docker.

16. **How do I update a service without downtime?**  
Use rolling updates with orchestration tools like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes; Compose itself does not support zero-downtime updates.

17. **Can Docker Compose be used in production?**  
Yes, Compose can be used for single-host deployments in production, but for complex orchestration, tools like Swarm or Kubernetes are recommended.

18. **How do I debug services running with Docker Compose?**  
Use `docker compose logs` for logs and `docker compose exec` to get an interactive shell inside containers.

19. **How do I customize networks in Docker Compose?**  
You can define custom networks in the Compose file under the `networks` section and assign services to them.

20. **How do I migrate from Docker Compose v1 to v2?**  
Use the new `docker compose` CLI plugin and update your workflows accordingly; most Compose files remain compatible. Refer to the official migration guide for details.
